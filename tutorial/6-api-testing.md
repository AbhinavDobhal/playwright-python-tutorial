# Part 6: API testing

Did you know that Playwright has support for built-in
[API testing](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api-testing)? 
While you could use Playwright for purely testing APIs,
this feature shines when used together with web UI testing.

In this part, we will learn how to use Playwright's API testing features by automating tests
for [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards).
These tests will be more complex than our previous DuckDuckGo search test.
They will also require additional setup.
