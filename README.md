# tau-playwright-workshop

This repository contains the example code for the Playwright workshop
for [TAU: The Homecoming](https://applitools.com/tau-homecoming/)
on December 1, 2021.
The workshop will be done in [Python](python.org).

This README contains full instructions for the workshop.
That way, you can still take this workshop even if you miss the main event!


## Workshop details

This section contains information about the workshop.


### Abstract

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/)
is a hot new browser automation tool from Microsoft.
With bindings for .NET, Java, JavaScript, and Python, it’s a strong alternative to Selenium WebDriver for end-to-end web app testing.

This workshop will be an introduction to Playwright using [Python](python.org).
We will automate a test scenario together that performs a [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search.
As we code along the test together, we will learn:

* How to install and configure Playwright
* How to integrate Playwright with [pytest](pytest.org), Python’s leading test framework
* How to perform interactions through page objects
* How to conveniently run different browsers, capture videos, and run tests in parallel

Come prepared with Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
By the end of the workshop, you will have a solid foundation in Playwright as well as a Python project you can extend with new tests!


### Prerequisites

To code along with this workshop, your machine must have Python 3.7 or higher.
You should also have a decent Python editor like
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
